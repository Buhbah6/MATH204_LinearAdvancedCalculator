# MATH204_LinearAdvancedCalculator
Advanced Calculator for Math 204: Vectors and Matrices, CEGEP and University Course.

Currently in development, with project led by Buhbah6 and Hypericat

The previous version of this project has been archived in the 'build2024' branch
Current and future versions will be pushed directly to 'main'

The target architecture for this project is an Angular frontend with a C++ backend through WebAssembly.
This will enable the application to run in the browser, and can later be bundled with something like Tauri or Electron to compile as a native .exe
Ideally, we'd also implement a LaTeX display engine such as MathJax (JavaScript)
